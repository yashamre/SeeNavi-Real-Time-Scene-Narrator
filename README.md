# 👁️ SeeNavi – Real-Time Scene Narration for the Visually Impaired

**SeeNavi** is a voice-controlled iOS app designed to assist visually impaired users by narrating their surroundings using advanced machine learning models. Powered by on-device camera access, speech recognition, OCR, and object detection, SeeNavi delivers hands-free, real-time scene understanding.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 **Image Captioning** – Describes scenes using BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining)
- 📖 **OCR (Text Recognition)** – Reads printed or handwritten text using Apple's Vision framework
- 🧭 **Object Detection** – Identifies objects with spatial context (e.g., "chair on the left")
- 🎙 **Voice Command Support** – Responds to:
  - “capture scene”
  - “read text”
  - “detect objects”
  - “replay caption”
  - “take photo” (hands-free capture)
- 🗣 **Speech Narration** – Speaks all outputs aloud using AVSpeechSynthesizer
- 📱 **Camera Integration** – Seamless live preview with voice-triggered photo capture

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- **SwiftUI** – Modern declarative UI framework
- **AVFoundation** – For audio output and speech synthesis
- **Speech Framework** – Real-time voice recognition
- **Vision Framework** – On-device OCR and object detection
- **CoreML** – Optional integration with BLIP or other ML models
- **Python Flask Server** – Image captioning backend (using `transformers`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 15+ device (real device required for camera/mic)
- Apple Developer Account (for deployment)
- Python backend with HuggingFace Transformers

### 📂 Setup

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SeeNavi.git
   cd SeeNavi
````

2. Open in Xcode:

   ```bash
   open SeeNavi.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Run the Python backend:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers flask torch pillow
   python decoder.py
   ```

4. Update IP in `ImageCaptioner.swift` to your server IP:

   ```swift
   let url = URL(string: "http://<your-ip>:5005/decode")!
   ```

5. Run the app on a physical device.
